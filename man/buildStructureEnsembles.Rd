\title{List files for a single ensemble member}
\usage{
buildStructureEnsembles(ensemblePath, coordinateFilenames, tasFilenames,
  timeFilenames)
}
\arguments{
\item{ensemblePath}{A character string that gives the absolute file path
for the subdirectory for a particular ensemble member of a climate
model within the user-specified projection directory.}

\item{coordinateFilenames}{Character string with filename of the file
containing the latitude and longitude coordinates in the bottom
directory of each ensemble member subdirectory. (See the package
vignette for an example of the required structure for this file.)}

\item{tasFilenames}{Character string with filename of the file
containing the climate projection data in the bottom
directory of each ensemble member subdirectory. (See the package
vignette for an example of the required structure for this file.)}

\item{timeFilenames}{Character string with filename of the file
containing the date dataframe in the bottom
directory of each ensemble member subdirectory. (See the package
vignette for an example of the required structure for this file.)}
}
\value{
A list of length 2. The first element is the name of the ensemble
that was processed. The second element is a list containing the coordinate
comma-separated file, the projection data comma-separated file,
and the time data comma-separated file, respectively.
}
\description{
This function reads through the user-specified projections directory and
creates a list with all files in the subdirectory of a single
ensemble member subdirectory within a specific climate model
subdirectory.
