Description: Takes locally saved climate projections and identifies and
    characterizes heatwaves in those projections. Heatwaves are defined
    based on a definition frequently used in climate epidemiology.
    Characterizations include several metrics of heatwave length,
    intensity, and timing in the summer. This work was supported in part by
    grants from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences
    (R00ES022631), the National Science Foundation (1331399), and the
    Colorado State University Vice President for Research.
