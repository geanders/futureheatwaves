Description: Inputs a directory of climate projection files and, for each,
    identifies and characterizes heat waves for specified study locations. The
    definition used to identify heat waves can be customized. Heat wave
    characterizations include several metrics of heat wave length, intensity,
    and timing in the year. The heat waves that are identified can be
    explored using a function to apply user-created functions across all
    generated heat wave files.This work was supported in part by grants from
    the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (R00ES022631), the
    National Science Foundation (1331399), and the Colorado State University
