\usage{
processHistorical(model, global, custom, reference = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{Character string of climate model name (e.g., "bcc1"). This
name is typically generated for use in this function from the subdirectory
names for the climate model within the directory of projection data
specified by the user in \code{gen_hw_set}.}

\item{global}{An object name for the 'global' variable list. This
parameter is passed through from \code{gen_hw_set} and includes user
specifications for the path to the output directory, the path to the
input climate projections, the dataframe with community locations, the
format for the filenames of the coordinate, tas, and time files in the
ensemble-specific subdirectories of the projection directory input by
the user, and whether the user prefers to run the function using the R
or C++ version of the function to identify heatwaves.}

\item{custom}{An object name for the 'custom` data list. This parameter is
passed through from \code{gen_hw_set} and includes user specifications
for, if specified as other than the default, an alternative function to
use to identify heatwaves, alternative upper and lower year boundaries
for the projection period of the heatwave datasets being generated,
and alternative upper and lower year boundaries for the reference period
to be used when measuring all heatwave characteristics related to
relative, rather than absolute, temperature.}

\item{reference}{FALSE, if the user has not specified custom reference
boundaries through the \code{referenceBoundaries} argument in
\code{gen_hw_set}, otherwise a vector with four elements
(earliest historical year, latest historical year,
earliest future projection year, latest future projection year)
giving the user-specified custom date boundaries for the
heatwave projections.}
}
\value{
Writes threshold temperatures to file and returns ... ?
}
\description{
This function calculates the threshold temperatures required to identify
   heatwaves in the climate projection data using each climate model's
   first listed historical ensemble. These values are both used in later
   functions to identify heatwaves in the projections and are also saved
   to file through this function to have for future reference.
