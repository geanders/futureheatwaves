Description: Takes a directory of climate projection files and, for each,
    identifies and characterizes all heat waves. The definition used to identify
    heat waves can be customized. Characterizations include several metrics of
    heat wave length, intensity, and timing in the year. Heat waves can be
    explored by applying custom functions across all generated heat wave files.
